    <h2>Jonathan James</h2>
    <p>The story of Jonathan James, known as "c0mrade," is a tragic one. He began hacking at a young age, managing to
      hack into several commercial and government networks and being sent to prison for it—all while he was still a
      minor. At the age of 15, James had enough with hacking his educational institutions and set bigger hacking goals.
      Between June 23, 1999, and October 27, 1999, he committed a series of intrusions into various systems. His first
      target was AT&T BellSouth, one of the largest telecommunications companies at the time in the US. The hacking
      details are not completely known, but C0mrade hacked into the company’s servers without doing any damage. His main
      goal was not to profit or stealing information but more about testing his hacking abilities on a bigger target
      like AT&T Bellsouth. In June 1999, he was looking for vulnerable servers to connect by bypassing their firewalls.
      <br>
      When he found one in Huntsville, Alabama, he went on and installed malware on it. He managed to escalate his
      privileges into the system, and then pivoted to another 13 computers on the compromised network. <br>
      The network comprised surprisingly belonged to a unit NASA, the Marshall Space Flight Center, located in
      Huntsville, Alabama. The unit has a lot of importance for NASA as it is the place where they develop and test
      rocket engines as well as communication systems for the ISS (International Space Station). C0mrade gained access
      to a program’s source code which controlled critical elements of life support of the ISS. The system was designed
      to maintain the physical environment in the living rooms of the ISS, and It was firstly estimated to worth
      millions of dollars. After NASA security experts discovered that their network was compromised, they disconnected
      the server, alongside the compromised machines for a period of 3 weeks to analyze the intrusion which led to 40
      thousand dollars direct damages for NASA. James eventually hacked into NASA's network and downloaded enough source
      code (assets equaling $1.7 million at the time) to learn how the International Space Station worked. NASA had to
      shut down its network for three entire weeks while they investigated the breach, costing an additional $41,000.
